##Quick Shiny Demo App 
This demo will help you to find cost of different procedures in your state. You can compare and select one that is fitting your needs

In this demo app, I'm filtering on a large dataset and showing sortable table.

Data Source: https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3

##Get Started
Select (multiple) states and procedure. Wait for record to be updated. Use search/filter in options to figure out best place to go for that procedure

##Issues
Data set size is huge, Response time will suffer, so please be patient while data is getting loaded
